    "Ans:-A database is a collection of structured data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval, updating, and management of the data. Databases are commonly used in various applications such as websites, enterprise systems, and mobile applications to store and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of databases that differ in their data models, query languages, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases use SQL as their query language to retrieve and manipulate data. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, and ability to handle complex transactions. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various data models such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, which is not suitable for a relational data model. NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the data model they use, and they are known for their high scalability, flexibility, and availability. However, NoSQL databases sacrifice strong consistency for high scalability, and they are usually eventual consistent, which means that data consistency is achieved over time rather than immediately. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB."

    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. The primary key ensures that each record in the table is uniquely identified and can be used as a reference by other tables in the database. A primary key must be unique and cannot contain null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table called \"employees\", the employee ID column could be used as the primary key. This ensures that each employee record in the table is uniquely identified and can be referenced by other tables in the database that need to relate to the employee record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table in the database. The foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing data to be joined and related between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table called \"orders\", the customer ID column could be used as a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the \"customers\" table. This allows the \"orders\" table to reference and relate to the corresponding customer record in the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that a foreign key must refer to an existing primary key in another table. If the primary key referenced by a foreign key is deleted or modified, the corresponding foreign key values in the referring table may need to be updated or deleted as well to maintain referential integrity."
